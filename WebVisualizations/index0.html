    <h1>Summary: Latitude  vs. X</h1>  
    <p>The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer
        to the equator. To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the
        OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities.
    </p>
    <p> After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the 
        weather vs. latitude. Factors we looked at included: temperature, cloudiness,
        wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source data and visualizations
        created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of analysis
        trends and correlations witnessed.
